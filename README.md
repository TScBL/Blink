Unfortunately, there's no host software available at the moment, but there's a driver you can download and install in preparation for the main program. 
Download the archive and run **InstallDrivers.exe** file (you might need an admin privilege for that) with your device plugged in. Once installation is complete, please reattach the device to check if the driver was configured properly.
